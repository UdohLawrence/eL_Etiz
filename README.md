
eL_Etiz.Website is a fun project that is expected to house a "store" of products
for eL_Etiz foods and confectioneries.

How does it work?
Using a local database (loaded in as a .json file), the application is able to
store and update all products as they are added to the "database".

How to run?
From your terminal/command prompt, clone the repository using the following command

https://github.com/UdohLawrence/eL_Etiz.git
next, run the following

cd eL_Etiz.Website
dotnet run

The project will start to run with the .json database prebuilt into its wwwroot folder.

Requirements
dotnetcore 5.0 sdk
